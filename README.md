ðŸ“Š Data Science Projects (Google Colab)

This repository contains three beginner-friendly data science and machine learning projects. All notebooks were developed and executed in Google Colab using popular Python libraries like `pandas`, `numpy`, `scikit-learn`, `matplotlib`, and `seaborn`.

ðŸš¢ 1. Titanic Survival Prediction

Objective: Predict whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster based on features like age, sex, ticket class, and fare.

Key Steps:
- Data cleaning (handling missing values and encoding categorical variables)
- Feature engineering (e.g., creating `FamilySize`)
- Model building using:
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- Model evaluation using accuracy and confusion matrix



ðŸŽ¬ 2. Movie Rating Prediction

**Objective**: Predict movie ratings using regression based on features like genre, director, and cast.

**Key Steps**:
- Data preprocessing (handling missing data, encoding genres and directors)
- Feature engineering
- Model building using:
- Linear Regression
- Random Forest Regressor
- Model evaluation using MAE, RMSE, and RÂ² score



ðŸŒ¸ 3. Iris Flower Classification

Objective: Classify iris flowers into three species based on petal and sepal measurements.

Key Steps:
- Data visualization and exploration
- Training models:
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Decision Tree
- Model evaluation using accuracy and confusion matrix


 ðŸ§° Tools & Environment

- Platform: Google Colab
- Languages: Python
- **Libraries:
- pandas
